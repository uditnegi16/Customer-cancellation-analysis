# Customer Cancellation Analysis ðŸ“Š

This project was completed as part of the **Professional AI Data Analytics Specialization** by DeepLearning.AI. The goal was to analyze customer churn-like behavior using the **Bakery Sales Dataset** from Kaggle and derive business insights using **Google Sheets**.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

**Bakery Sales Dataset**  
ðŸ“Ž [Kaggle Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hosubjeong/bakery-sales/data)

This dataset simulates daily transactions in a bakery, including:
- Product types
- Purchase timestamps
- Customer behavior (indirectly analyzed as churn-like trends)
- Sales and quantity data

## ðŸ“Œ Objective

To simulate a customer cancellation (churn) analysis by identifying patterns in:
- Purchase contracts and frequency
- Promotions and offers
- Product types with recurring sales
- Revenue patterns and transaction trends

## ðŸ“Š Tools Used

- **Google Sheets** for:
  - Data cleaning and structuring
  - Conditional formulas (e.g., `IF`, `COUNTIFS`, `VLOOKUP`)
  - Charting (grouped columns, scatter plots)
  - Exploratory data analysis

## ðŸ§  Key Insights

1. **Purchase Frequency and Churn**  
   - Customers with sporadic purchases are more likely to churn.
   - Consistent buyers showed stable trends across categories.

2. **Offers and Retention**  
   - Certain promotions (e.g., B, D, E) correlated with higher retention.

3. **Online Features**  
   - Products/services with add-ons (like security in a real SaaS setting) had better loyalty.

4. **Tenure and Spending**  
   - Long-tenure buyers contributed more to revenue and had lower churn.

## ðŸ§ª Tasks Performed

- Logical segmentation of purchase behavior
- Trend analysis using formulas
- Calculation of churn proportions
- Visualizing time-based and category-based trends
- Annotating key observations

## ðŸ–¼ Visual Outputs

All screenshots from the Sheets are available in `/screenshots/`, including:
- Churn proportion by product/offer
- Churn by tenure or revenue brackets
- Category-level breakdowns
- Step-wise analysis progression
